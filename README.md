### About

The last column contained binary values (0 and 1) indicating whether a job posting is fraudulent or not. The aim of the project was to identify the industry with the highest fraudulent job postings while displaying the results graphically.
To do that, the data was grouped based on the industry column while summing the fraudulent postings for each industry. The resulting data frame was then plotted using a bar chart and displayed.
### Technologies used
Python programming language was used for this analysis. The data was imported and manipulated using the Pandas library. Visualization was made using the matplotlib.pyplot library and the Seaborn library. Jupiter notebook was used to write the code.
